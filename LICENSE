I don't care what you do, so long as you don't:

 - use this software to kill innocent people
 - say you made it all by yourself
 - try to sell it

If you just follow those rules, who gives a f*ck?

There's no warranty on this game,
if you break something, it's your own damn fault.


A lot of the art comes from Open Game Art.

The exact sources have been lost, but they are all open source licences
to some extent.
If you recognize something that you made, feel free to contact whoever
is in charge of the project (currently me), and they'll add the proper
attribution. (or make a slightly different image to use instead, if you prefer)
Remember, it's just 256 pixels.
Because of the many different licenses, this game (p3600) is
mostly unlicensable. (at least the art is)
Of course, once again, if you just play nice, who gives a f*ck?

The font is based on the allegro 4 default font.
