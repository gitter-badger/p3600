Some of the characters are inspired by players from other games. (mostly RPGs)
They are asked first, and if they said no, then they aren't added.


1: Saoirse
----------

From: Monster Hunter

A crazy shapeshifter that enjoys challenges.
If a task is easy, she always tries to find someone else to do it.

Fought a level 140 rajang alone, naked, and won.
"I was bored.", she later explained.

Extremely witty, and rarely serious, she often throws fights because she
gets bored.  However, she does display a calm, level-headed veneer when
the situation calls for it; some might even say cold and calculating.
The rest of the time, she acts happy, almost ditzy.

Likes to have a tail, makes it disappear to confuse people.
Blind in her right eye.
Likes telling people she is related to Becenji. (She's not.)
